# **Moody Melodies - CSE 110 Project**

A Web app designed for fellow UCSD students to help them find and listen to recommended music playlists to help destress and fit their emotional needs. This project was developed over several weeks by a group of UCSD students to create an app that would help address the stresses of student life. Our music-based project lets users take surveys that will personalize a curated musical playlist that fits them. Whether a user needs a calming playlist of LoFi beats or energizing EDM, we wanted to give users a way to have personalized playlists created based on their mood.
