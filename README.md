# **Moody Melodies - CSE 110 Project**

A Web app designed for fellow UCSD students to help them find and listen to recommended music playlists to help destress and fit their emotional needs. This project was developed over several weeks by a group of UCSD students to create an app that would help address the stresses of student life. Our music-based project lets users take surveys that will personalize a curated musical playlist that fits them. Whether a user needs a calming playlist of LoFi beats or energizing EDM, we wanted to give users a way to have personalized playlists created based on their mood. 

### Project File Structure & Code ###

The file structure consists of two main folders, one for the server side and another for the application's client side. Within those files, there's a folder for components and the different webpages as views that are called in App.tsx. The code is mostly made up of Typescript, CSS, and HTML since our course labs focused on these languages. We decided to use MongoDB for our database since there were members on our team with prior experience. 

### Login ###

The login page lets users create their own accounts which will let them save recommended playlists. 

### Home ###

The home page lets users see all their saved playlists and serves as the page that has the rest of the features of our web app. Here, users can edit and delete playlists whenever they want. They can also access the surveys through here.

### Surveys ###

The survey has two types: a simple one-question survey that gives users a quick recommendation or a more 'advanced' survey that gives users more personalized recommendations.
